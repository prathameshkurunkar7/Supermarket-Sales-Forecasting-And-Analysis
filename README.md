> A Data Science driven solution for Supermarket Sales and its effect on inventory optimizations.

### Description :blue_book:
Inventories can either make or break a business. Having an inventory management solution is a must in todayâ€™s modern digital era.
Our solution focuses on solving this problem of mismanaged inventories for several businesses by providing them with an interactive and functional dashboard powered by Machine Learning and Data Science techniques to attain maximum efficiency. Our project forecasts the most optimal quantity to possess in an inventory for a particular month whilst taking into account several factors such as the history of product sales, seasonal trends like what the consumers demand at a particular period of time, external factors which affect the sales, and financial insights. Our solution also puts light on giving comprehensive details regarding a particular business by the virtue of in-depth analysis and interactive visualizations.
